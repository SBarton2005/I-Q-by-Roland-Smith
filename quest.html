    <center><h2>Known as Q</h2></center>
    <center><p>Q is a 13 year old boy who wants to be a magician. He wears cargo pants all of the time do to this, filled with multiple decks of cards, scarves, coins, and so much more. An interesting character with an interesting journey, being the only character who knows the truth that didn't choose to enter the situation or is excited about it. Our sort of normal character that you can relate to, the one who isn't extremely intelligent or a good fighter. His magician skils do come in handy though, as he does some lying and cheating, along with escaping from plenty of things. Q is an exciting character, and with the story told main from his point of view, it is very fun to read.</p></center>
