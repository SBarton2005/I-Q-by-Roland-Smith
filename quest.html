    <center><h2>Known as Q</h2></center>
    <center><p>Q is a 13 year old boy who wants to be a magician. Many think he says musician like his parents, but he almost always corrects them. He usually wear cargo pants because they have a lot of pockets and he always keeps rope, multiple decks of cards, and a bunch of other things on him. Before the book, he lived with his mom on a boat. During the book he's living in a trailer with his mother, stepfather, and stepsister.

    <center><p>The point of view character for most of the story and the main character along with Angela, Q has an interesting journey in the book (since he doesn't want to be dealing with terrorists like Angela does). He helps make this story what it is, and is a great addition since he is the one normal character who is involved and not being kept in the dark.</p></center>
