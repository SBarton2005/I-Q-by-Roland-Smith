    <h2>Known as Speed</h2></center>
    <center><p>The character you didn't really expect to see in the book is Speed, but then he becomes big. He appears in odd places, but that can be explained away. Then comes the sixth book, they are still trying to figure out who is number one in the Ghost Cell, and it is who nobody expects. Speed is the number one. A crazy guitarist is the number one. It was an excellent cover. And there is something else. Like Boone, Speed was exposed to the Holy Grail. Q has a portion of the powers that come with it. Speed is a portion of these books that just makes you want to shout, "This makes so much sense but doesn't!" It is so odd,but it makes for a brilliant plot twist. Speed is a character that practically came from no where and turns out to be one of the most important players in the game.</p></center>
