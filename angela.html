    <center><h1>Angela</h1></center>
    <center><p>Angela is a 15 year old girl who wants to be a secret service agent, just like her deceased mother. Her father does not like this since he doesn't want her to die as well, so she doesn't talk about her dream much. She enjoys taekwondo, which has become useful in the story. Angela is a vegetarian like her father, though in truth she is eats meat as well behind her fathers back. She is a great role model, showing that girls can do just as well as boys. Actually, she does better than Q in most parts, though he is a better escape artist.</p></center>
