    <center><h1>Angela</h1></center>
    <center><p>Angela is a 15 year old girl who wants to be a secret service agent, just like her deceased mother. Her father, Roger, hates that idea because he doesn't want her to die as well, so Angela doesn't talk about it much. She is much more studious then Q. Like her father, she is vegetarian, though it turns out that she is a closet carnivore. She is living in the van with Q during the course of the books.

    <center><p>Our female protagonist in the story,Angela is a great role model, even if a bit crazy since she likes having to deal with a terrorist organization, happy to be dragged along for the ride. Having been interested in this for a long time and having been practicing taekwondo, she is a bit more useful in a lot of situations that Q.
