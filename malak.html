    <center><h1>Malak</h1></center>
    <center><p>The mother of Angela, Malak is a former secret service agent thought to be dead in service by almost everybody. It turns out that isn't the truth, in fact it is Malak's twin sister that died in the explosion. Both Malak and her sister were seperated at birth and raised to join the Ghost Cell, the terrorist agency that is a problem. Malak didn't join, but her sister did. When she died,since they looked a like, Malak took her spot to inflitrate the Ghost Cell and rise through the ranks. Some may say it's easier being dead,but for Malak that is definitly not true.</p></center>
