    <center><p>Tyrone Boone is just a really old roadie with a really old dog named Crockett(Croc), or at least that is what you would like to think. First of all, Boone and Croc being really old is true. It just happens that really old means having been around for millennia. Boone was originally a Templar Knight, and was exposed to the Holy Grail along with Croc. They now age extremely slowly and have the ability to move extremely fast, practically teleport. Boone is a former NOC CIA agent, who's cover was as a roadie. Now he is the leader of a group known as <a href="sos.html">SOS</a>(Some Old Spooks). He is still undercover as a roadie, which he uses to stick with Q and Angela by pretending to work as a roadie for their parents. Though, he does make a pretty good roadie for them after all these years.</p></center>
