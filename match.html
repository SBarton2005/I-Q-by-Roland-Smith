    <h1>Match</h1>
    <h2>The Duo of Blaze & Roger</h2>
    <center><p>Blaze Munoz and Roger Tucker are a recently married music duo known together as Match. They are currently on the middle of a tour for their new album after just getting married. Roger is a vegetarian and Blaze is trying to adapt to that and have Q adapt as well(which is not working). They are both ignorant of the things happening in the shadow,which is good for them. Roger most definitly doesn't need to know about this, and if Blaze knew about Speed... let's just say that they are better off not knowing.</p></center>
