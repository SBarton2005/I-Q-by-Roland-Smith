    <center><h1><em>I, Q</em> by Roland Smith</h1>
    <h3>A bit of a reference, a bit of a fan page</h3>
    <h2>By Sarah Barton</h2></center>
    <p>This series of six books centered around a boy named Quest(Q) and a girl named Angela is a great mystery and spy story for those not yet into reading books from the adult section. The two of them, stepsiblings, are dragged into this confusing situation, involving the president of the United States, some old former intelligence people, mossad agents, a ghost terrorist cell, Q's crazy father, and Angela's supposedly dead mother. It's a fun rollar coaster ride, that is also great to reread. I've read this story so many times, and even though it is a bit of a mystery, rereading it doesn't ever ruin the story. I hope you read the book yourself and enjoy it like I did. Warning to everyone, there will be spoilers in most of the character sections and book sections, so use this as more of a refresher than a "do I want to read this book?"</p>
